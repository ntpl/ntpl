SiO2 high pressure phase of Stishovite. The unit cell was relaxed using VASP with 'PSTRESS = 400' in INCAR. In BORN file, Born effective charges of atom 1 and 3 are written. Dielectric and Born effetive charge tensors were calculated using VASP with 'LEPSILON = .TRUE.' in INCAR. Band structure with LO-TO splitting is plotted by
