Introduction :
--------------

This directory contains several files that explore some of the functionality of GULP
and serve as examples of typical input files.

NB: Except where library files are used, the user should not take the potential models
in the example files to be of publication quality. They are just examples of how the
code will run and may not be proper potentials for the system in question!
