This directory contains a simple bit of code to convert binary to ASCII format. 
It's simple because it doesn't contain error checking to make sure the user is
supplying sane input data, so beware! The input to the program should be a file
containing:

Line 1: Binary trajctory file name
Line 2: ASCII trajctory file name
Line 3: true or false according to whether calculation is constant pressure or not

To compile the code do something like:

gfortran -o mdb2a mdbin2ascii.f90

To run, assuming that you have put the 3 lines above into a file called "convert":

mdb2a < convert
