  subroutine electricfieldparts(fieldx,fieldy,fieldz)
!
!  Subroutine for calculating the potential due to an external
!  electric field. Note that this can should only be done in non-periodic
!  directions and that the potential is defined as the integral of the
!  field/per charge relative to the initial geometry.
