  subroutine outgen
!
!  Subroutine for outputing general parameter information
!
!  11/97 Created from part of gulp.F
!   5/03 Setting of lperiodic now tests for dimension to be
!        greater than or equal to 1 - not just 3.
!  10/04 Target Ewald radius added to output
!  11/07 Modifications for reaxFF Coulomb term added
!   1/08 lreaxFFqreal removed
!   8/09 Output of lattice sum name modified to include options
!        other than Ewald in name.
