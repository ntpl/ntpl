  subroutine celltype(itype,icfhr)
!
!  Determines what class of cell is applicable based on parameters
!
!   9/04 Rewritten to use the space group to determine the values
!        rather than just the cell parameters, since the latter can
!        be misleading
!  10/04 Correction for non-standard space groups (> 230) added
!   8/05 Modified to handle user specified cell types
!
!  On return:
!
!  itype = 1 => triclinic
!        = 2 => monoclinic
!        = 3 => orthorhombic
!        = 4 => tetragonal
!        = 5 => icfhr = 0 => hexagonal
!               icfhr = 1 => trigonal
!        = 6 => cubic
