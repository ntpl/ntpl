				A dictionary holding key:value pairs. Each key
				is original string to be replaced and each value
				is the new string to be subsituted.
			orig : str
				A string containing the original file name. If
				the file is not included in the pathway then it
				can be the absolute or relative pathway to the
				file.

				A string containing the new file name. If the

				creating a new one.
