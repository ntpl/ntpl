[2.0] - Documentation
	[2.1] - def buildNumpy
		This creates numpy array based on the blocks provided

		lattice.Numpy.buildNumpy(blocks)
		Parameters
		----------
			blocks : list of type Block
				The blocks used to build the numpy array. Blocks
				should be put in order of origin to z-direction
				max.
		Returns
		----------
			Numpy : numpy array
				A numpy array of shape (numAtoms, 3) and type
				float is returned.
	[2.2] - class Lammps
		Creates and object that represents a single lammps file

		ntpy.lattice.Lammps(file_name)
		Parameters
		----------
			file_name : str
				The name of the lammps file

		[2.2.1] - def buildLammps
			This creates and writes the lammps file based on the blocks provided

			ntpy.lattice.Lammps.buildLammps(blocks)
			Parameters
			----------
				blocks : list of type Block
					The blocks used to build the lammps file. Blocks
					should be put in order of origin to z-direction
					max.

	[2.3] - class Xyz
		Creates an object that represents a single xyz file.

		ntpy.lattice.Xyz(file_name)
		Parameters
		----------
			file_name : str
				The name of the xyz file

		[2.3.1] - def buildXyz
			This creates and writes the xyz file based on the blocks provided

			ntpy.lattice.Xyz.buildXyz(blocks)
			Parameters
			----------
				blocks : list of type Block
					The blocks used to build the lammps file. Blocks
					should be put in order of origin to z-direction
					max.

	[2.4] - class Block
		Defines a singular lattice that can linearly interfaced with other lattices

		ntpy.lattice.Block(lat_vector, lat_type, dim, bd_space=0, atom_mass=None, atom_type=None)
		Parameters
		----------
			lat_vector : list of type float
				The lattice constants for the x, y, and z directions
			lat_type : str
				The type of lattice to be constructed. Currently only
				'sc', 'fcc', 'bcc', and 'diamond' are supported
			dim : list of type int
				The dimensions of the lattice in the x, y, and z directions.	
				Dimensions are in units of lattice units.
			bd_space : float, optional
				The amount of space added at the terminating z boundary of
				the lattice. The space added is relative to the standard
				periodic foundary of the lattice. A negative value reduces
				the amount of space at the boundary.
			atom_mass : list of type float, optional
				The atom masses corresponding to the atoms in the basis vector.
				If only one mass is used then only one mass need be supplied.
				For a listing of the basis vector for each lattice type used
				by this module, use the lattice function "basis_print".
				Required for lammps files.
			atom_type : list of type str, optional
				The atom types of the lattice. Required for xyz files.

	[2.5] - def printBasis
		Prints the basis vectors defined in this module for reference

		ntpy.lattice.printBasis(lat_type)
		Parameters
		----------
			lat_type : str
				The type of lattice to be constructed. Currently only
				'sc', 'fcc', 'bcc', and 'diamond' are supported
